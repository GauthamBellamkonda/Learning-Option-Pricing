# Giving Credit and Thanks

Hey there,

This folder includes a lot of code I've borrowed by copy-pasting from [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/quantgirluk/Understanding-Quantitative-Finance). I want to give a shoutout and a big thank you to [QuantGirl](https://quantgirl.blog/), who originally wrote these notebooks. Check out her [website](https://quantgirl.blog/), and her new project [Understanding Quantitative Finance](https://quantgirluk.github.io/Understanding-Quantitative-Finance/intro.html)
